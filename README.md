# Cold Calling AI Agent

## Project Overview
The Cold Calling AI Agent is a web application that leverages local large language models (LLMs) and Twilio's telephony API for conducting automated cold calls. This application allows users to initiate calls to specified phone numbers, interact via voice, receive responses generated by an AI conversational agent, and log all interactions. With a user-friendly interface, it provides functionality for call management and logs retrieval, streamlining the cold calling process.

## Installation

To set up the Cold Calling AI Agent locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cold-calling-ai-agent
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   You need Python 3.7 or higher and pip. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi python-dotenv twilio llama-cpp
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following variables:
   ```plaintext
   TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=<your_account_sid>
   TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=<your_auth_token>
   TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=<your_twilio_phone_number>
   LLM_MODEL_PATH=<path_to_your_llm_model>
   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**
   The database will be initialized automatically when you run the application for the first time. Ensure you have SQLite installed.

## Usage

To run the application, use the command:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start the FastAPI application on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Accessing the Application
Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the Cold Calling AI Agent dashboard. From there, you can initiate calls, view active calls, and access the call logs.

## Features

- **Initiate Voice Calls:** Start a call to a specified phone number.
- **Interactive AI Responses:** Engage with an AI that generates conversational responses in real-time during calls.
- **Call Logging:** Automatically log all interactions, including user input and AI responses.
- **View Call History:** Access a history of calls made, including their statuses.
- **Frontend Dashboard:** A responsive and user-friendly interface that facilitates call management.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for this project, and should be installed via pip:
- `fastapi`
- `python-dotenv`
- `twilio`
- `llama-cpp`
- `uvicorn`

## Project Structure

The project's structure is organized as follows:

```
cold-calling-ai-agent/
├── index.html              # Frontend HTML for the application dashboard
├── main.py                 # Main application code (FastAPI server)
├── call_handler.py         # Module for handling Twilio calls
├── llm_interface.py        # Module for interfacing with the LLM model
├── database.py             # Module for database interactions
├── .env                    # Environment variables (not included in the repository)

```

### File Descriptions
- **`main.py`:** Contains the FastAPI application setup, routing, and webhook configurations.
- **`call_handler.py`:** Manages the interactions with the Twilio API for initiating calls.
- **`llm_interface.py`:** Interfaces with the local LLM to generate responses based on speech input.
- **`database.py`:** Handles all database interactions for logging calls and fetching logs.
- **`index.html`:** The web dashboard where users can manage calls and view logs.
